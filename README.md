## Please read ‚ö†Ô∏è

Git comes with a garbage collector ([in case you didn't know](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc)) therefore undoing some commands will become impossible if the entries are deleted from the reflog.
One way to prevent this is to increase default time limits before the reflog entries expire:
Add these configuration in your global `.gitconfig` file:

```gitconfig
[gc]
    # default 90 days
    reflogExpire = 200
```
Used to set how long records in a branches reflog should be preserved.

```gitconfig
[gc]
    # default 30 days
    reflogExpireUnreachable = 90

```
Used to set how long inaccessible reflog records should be preserved.
